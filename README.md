Quickly and easily create your VTM character & export to printable, editable PDF.

The creator runs entirely in your browser, no files are sent to a server.

This is a 'Vampire: The Masquerade' character creation tool for beginners. It is intentionally streamlined and limited to creating a common type of character following the rules from the source book. You can download your character into a printable PDF when you're done (PDF template kindly provided by [Nerdbert](https://linktr.ee/nerdbert)) and also save it to a local JSON file that you can load into this web app to continue editing.


## How to run
* `npm install`
* `npm start`

* (optional) create `.env` file and enter environment variables like `VITE_VARIABLE_NAME = 'some value'`

<!-- ## How to use -->

<!-- ## How to use your own fillable pdf
* Convert your pdf to base64 (you can use `scripts/pdfToBase64.ts`)
* Import & load it in `pdfCreator.ts`
* Use `printFieldNames()` to get names of fillable fields
* Map character attributes generated in `Generator.tsx` to pdf field names -->


<!-- ## TODOs:
* Add free-text / select field where predator type says "pick XY"?
* Add free-text custom merit/flaw field(s) for users to input their own stuff

* Make instruction-text prettier / styled (check out similar web apps for how they do it?)
* Make merit/flaw picking prettier - maybe style it more like a character sheet (with the oooo)

* Ask for feedback in VtM spaces
  * Randomized name, ambition, desire etc
  * Post and ask for feedback again once you have all these completed (v2 release)

* Add more loresheets
* Fix: Setting Specialites, then going back and setting new specialties keeps the old ones
* Fix: Changing predator type should reset disciplines (like changing clan does, search "Because you changed your clan")
* -->
