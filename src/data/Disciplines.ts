He cannot outright imitate an existing person and he will always possess some recognizable features which can be picked up on by those who know them, but can otherwise use this ability to trick most people into believing he is someone else. ❖ Hermaphrodite: The Kindred can change their sex as desired in order to fool enemies and seduce targets based on their preference. This does not outright change the identity of the Kindred but it does make their appearance more feminine or more masculine accordingly. ❖ Face Of Progress: The users face takes on a fearsome alien aspect. Any mortal who gazes upon the Kindred must pass a Willpower test (2) or flee the Scene.

For story purposes the blood itself is also animated to a degree and any wounds caused at close range will reflexively jettison out a small trickle of vitae to automatically strike the users assailant. ❖ Cocoon: The Kindred automatically manifests a cocoon around their body as they enter Torpor. The cocoon is made out of an oil secreted by the Kindred's body and crystalizes into a solid, fire-resistant shell. Repeated attacks can eventually break open the cocoon but the difficulty is similar to trying to break open a safe. ❖ Liquefy The Mortal Coil: The vampire's palms become covered with small barbs. These inject the victim with a minuscule portion of the Kindred's blood as the user places the palm of his hands on the target (a successful Touch attack is needed). The corrupted vitae devours flesh and rots away bone, liquifying portions of the target's body in moments.

The user adds 1 dice to all physical rolls and can chose to activate up to 2 additional Flesh Works Effects (no additional Rouse Checks are needed). ❖ Bloodform: The Kindred's body liquefies into a blood red ichor.

He cannot be affected by powers which require Eye Contact and cannot use any of his other abilities nor use any other Effects from Flesh Works.

The Kindred can now target others with Flesh Works as long as he touches the intended target. However, unless the target possesses Vicissitude themselves, they take a point of Aggravated Damage as the effects manifest. ❖ Doppelgänger: The user can perfectly mimic the physical properties and vocal cords of an individual they drank from. Unlike other vampiric powers, which focus on tricking the mind, this ability outright physically alters the user to look like their targets perfect copy. The ability can be kept going at the end of each Scene if an additional Rouse Check is made. The user does not inherit any of the targets supernatural or physical qualities aside from their looks. ❖ Chiropteran Marauder: This ability works exactly like Horrid Form with the exception that the user can only chose 1 additional Flesh Work Effect, instead of 2, and grows massive wings granting them the ability of semi-flight.
